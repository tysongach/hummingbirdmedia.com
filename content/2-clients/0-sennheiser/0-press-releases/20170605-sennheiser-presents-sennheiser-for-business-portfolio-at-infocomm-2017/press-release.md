“We are excited to offer the opportunity for US customers to learn more about our growing 'Sennheiser for Business’ offering.

High quality audio is therefore becoming a vital asset to organizations of every size and in every industry. Sennheiser is excited to be presenting a strong portfolio of solutions to meet and exceed these rapidly evolving customer demands.”

**TeamConnect Wireless Tray-M Set - Turn any room into a meeting venue**
This year, Sennheiser has expanded its TeamConnect Wireless portable wireless conference system with the TeamConnect Wireless Tray-M Set. This more compact configuration - with two rather than four satellites – is a perfect solution for dedicated meeting rooms and conferences for up to 12 participants. Boasting award-winning design, TeamConnect Wireless provides excellent sound for online meetings.  The system delivers multiple connectivity options with any smartphone, laptop or PC via Bluetooth, USB, or 3.5mm jack - brilliant flexibility to cater for a broad range of Unified Communications demands.

**SpeechLine Boundary 114-S DW - The experience of simplicity with the freedom of wireless**
Dedicated to speech, Sennheiser’s SpeechLine Boundary 114-S DW extends the capability of the TeamConnect conferencing system with a wireless solution. Easily adapted to any conference, it optimizes speech-intelligibility so that conference participants don’t need to speak directly into or even sit close to the microphone. As well as charging via USB, the SL Boundary 114-S DW offers the simplicity of wireless charging and is compatible with Sennheiser’s CHG 2W, an inductive charging solution that can charge two mobile devices simultaneously. The new microphone delivers a winning combination of performance, flexibility and intuitive fuss-free set-up and operation, with detailed monitoring and control made possible with Sennheiser’s comprehensive Control Cockpit software suite.

Sennheiser’s booth at InfoComm (Audio Pavilion – booth 4947) will include a “Sennheiser for Education” showcase, which will feature products from the MobileConnect and speech-dedicated SpeechLine DW range.  There will also be a Sennheiser for “House of Worship” showcase, allowing visitors to learn about solutions that help to meet the diverse needs of such institutions. These range from the newly launched Digital 6000, a high-end digital wireless solution ideal for mega-churches, to easy to use wireless options such as the XS Wireless 2 that’s well suited to small and mid-sized churches. This area will also present wired solutions for music including the evolution 600/800 series as well as solutions for in ear monitoring (2000 IEM series).
