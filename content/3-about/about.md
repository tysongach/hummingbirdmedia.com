Story: 

Hummingbird Media is a boutique public relations firm serving premium clients in the Pro Audio, MI, Systems Integration and Consumer Electronics industry. We help our clients articulate the essence of their brand using a combination of modern and traditional communications mediums and world class tool sets.

We are committed to long-term, value-driven relationships with both our clients and a diverse set of media. We choose to work with a handful of passionate, innovative clients over a long period of time versus our competitors, who typically work with many companies — often competing with one another — over short periods of time.
